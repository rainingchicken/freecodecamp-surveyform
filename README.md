# freecodecamp-surveyform

### Description
This is a website of survey forms to collect data of phone usage. Inputs include name, email, age of user, phone operating system, screen time, used apps, and favorite app. 

### Purpose
First project created to get Responsive Web Design certificate from freecodecamp.org

### Progress
First upload are codes written from memeory with no help from any sources so it looks pretty bad and basic. It was miserable as there was no auto complete or starting template. The spacing with the nesting was all by hand as well. But I did well not consulting the internet or past examples. I will come back and style it more interestingly and js script to collect submitted form and whatever else that makes the website look better.
